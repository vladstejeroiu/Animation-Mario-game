# Mario
Simple 2D Game in HTML with JavaScript.
# Goal
Developed a simple 2D game shown in a Canvas. This animation-based application has a character that jumps when the click button is pressed, thus accumulating one point. The idea is avoiding obstacles for as long as possible and the final score is represented by the sum of points.
